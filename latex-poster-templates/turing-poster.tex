%% Our corporate brand is Neue Haas Unica Pro, but we don't have a general
%% license to use it. Our corporate substitute font is Arial, perhaps because
%% Windows has Arial. But Helvetica is closer in design to Neue Haas Unica Pro,
%% and I don't think Arial is available on Linux by default.

%% Layout
%% ------
%% The portrait Turing poster appears to use a 9 vertical x 21 horizontal
%% grid. The actual measurements in the PowerPoint don't quite match, but
%% presumably the gris is what was intended.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or
no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought
I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I
have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find
myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in
my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,
and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my
hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I
can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish
Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing
surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some
time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

\section*{Clear/informative section heading}
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as
Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left,
the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that
noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous
were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to
Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?—Posted
like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of
mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated
upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some
high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward
peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied
to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the
green fields gone? What do they here?
